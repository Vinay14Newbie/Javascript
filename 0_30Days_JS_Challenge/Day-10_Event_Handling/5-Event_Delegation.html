<!-- Event delegation in js is a pattern that efficiently handles events. Events can be added to a parent element instead of adding to every single element. It refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated -->

    <!-- By default, events triggered on an element propagate up the DOM tree to the element's parent, its ancestors, and on up until the root element(html) -->
    <!-- 'div' which is a parent of a 'span' which in turn is a parent of the 'button' element -->
    <!-- Due to event bubbling, when the button receives an event, say click, that event bubbles up the tree, so 'span' and 'div' will respectively receive the event also -->
